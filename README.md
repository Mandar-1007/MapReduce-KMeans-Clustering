# MapReduce-KMeans-Clustering
This project implements the K-means clustering algorithm using Java and Hadoop MapReduce. It processes a large dataset of 3-dimensional points to iteratively assign points to clusters and update cluster centroids until convergence. The project demonstrates big data processing techniques, distributed computation, and scalable clustering using multiple iterations.

# Key features:
1) Multi-iteration K-means implementation.
2) Customizable number of clusters (K) and iterations (R)
3) Developed using IntelliJ IDEA, designed for Hadoop-compatible environments
